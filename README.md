## Description:
It is a travel and tourism app which focuses on more remote areas as well as user hosted accomodations and our aim to get more people to go to and be aware of less accessible / non-tourist hotspot areas in order for people to be more awake and explore local cultures other than just from major tourist destinations; also to be more affordable and accessible than conventional tour groups for people who want to travel. Another is to help locals gain revenue and recognition by making more remote areas more easily accessible and known to tourists.

## Features:
- Ratings, Reviews and Recommendations
- Descriptions of local specialties and cultures
- Discussions Page
- Ability to host or book travel accomodations
- Communications between host and visitor(s)

## Prototype:
An early interactive prototype of the website design is available at https://app.uizard.io/p/a01ace03
